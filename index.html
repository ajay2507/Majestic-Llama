						   <p>The llama is a South American relative of the camel, though the llama does not have a hump. Llamas, like other camelids have long necks, limbs, rounded muzzles, protruding lower incisors, and a cleft upper lip.
								These sturdy creatures are domestic animals used by the peoples of the Andes Mountains.
								Llamas are fairly large mammals standing about 1.21 m at the shoulder and about 1.2 m in length from head to tail. Majestic Llama can weigh from 130 to 155 kg. Unlike some other Artiodactyla,
								Llama has a two toed foot with a thick leathery pad on each foot’s sole.
								Llamas browse on low shrubs, lichens, and mountain vegetation, they consume about 2 to 3 gallons of water and 1.8% of their body weight in dry food (grass, hay) per day. Llamas have an unusually high content of hemoglobin in their bloodstream and oval shaped red blood corpuscles, both of which are adaptaions for surviving in an oxygen-poor, high altitude environment.
								Llamas are gregarious and highly social, living in groups of up to 20 individuals.

						<h2>LLAMA POWER</h2>
						<h4>“Men. You can't live with them...and you can't legally shoot them. I tossed out my husband eight years ago and got a llama instead. Best decision I ever made.”
― Jodi Picoult, Lone Wolf</h4>

										<h3>Versatile Companion</h3>
									<p>
Llamas are considered one of the most enjoyable large animals that one can own. They are extremely intelligent, very beautiful and graceful, and carry themselves with elegance. A gentle companion for all ages, easy and rather inexpensive to keep, and easily trained, llamas adapt easily to many different situations and have numerous enjoyable uses. A member of the camelid family, llamas are a herd animal, but react very positively with people. Extremely versatile, they come in a wide variety of colors, sizes, personalities, and price ranges.</p>

								<h3 >Packed Animal</h3>
									<p>  Llamas make excellent pack animals. They can carry 50-125 pounds, but are not ridden except by children. Their two-toed foot with its leathery bottom pad gives
     them great sure-footedness. This foot, and the llamas "cafeteria" style browsing
      habit, give the llama an impact on the environment equal to a large deer. They will accept a halter, loading in and out of vehicle, pulling a cart, carrying goods, etc.</p>

								<h3>Exquisite Fiber</h3>
									<p>A prized product of llamas is their fiber. Exceptionally woolly animals, their lanolin-free wool is fine, soft, and warm - greatly appreciated by spinners, knitters, and weavers. Many commercial processors specialize in cleaning, carding, and spinning and can turn this luxurious raw fiber into rovings and yarns. Many individual create beautiful garments, household items, and works of art with processes such as knitting, weaving, hooking, and felting.</p>

													 <h2>Excuse me don't threaten me!!!</h2>
													 <p>Llama use to spit when provoked or threatened intentionally. Llamas are social animals and like to stay in a herd. Just like humans, llamas also follow the social ranking method. The more disciplined llamas are kept at the top of the ladder. Llamas that spit and fight are kept at the lower order, but these social rankings are not static. A small fight can destroy the disciplined character of a llama and it will then fall down the ladder in social rankings.</p>
